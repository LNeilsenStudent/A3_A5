            The Quick Quotes Calculator (which we are going to call as QQC throughout this document) is a mobile app which aims to streamline the process of quoting jobs which is done by tradies very commonly. The QQC will primarily be targeted towards tradespeople and sole traders who regularly need to quote complex jobs. The app would allow the user to quickly tally up the quantity and cost price for each line item of any given task, with users being able to customize job names and types, making it a more streamlined and accurate process. This information is used to instantly generate an itemized quote that is individualized and can be exported to other apps such as email for streamlined customer experience. The user interface is going to be very consumer friendly and easy to use with very easy to understand prompts and animations to make it look trendier and more attractive. It is going to be a very trendy app which will look very attractive to the customer and while designing we are going to be mindful that our main customers are going to be tradies so it’s going to suit their appetite and it’s going to be main user interface design constrain. It will have customer relation management (CRM) functionality also.

                According to <a href="https://hipages.com.au/tradie/success-guide/top-tips-for-quoting/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20tradies%20are%20spending,full%20day's%20work%20every%20week">Hipages, 2023</a>, “trade workers spend an average of seven hours a week preparing quotes”. This equates to nearly 20% of the entire working week. Much of this time is spent summing up quantities, and total values for each job item. If the tradesperson were to make any errors in calculations, many hours may be spent trying to find the mistake. This figure will likely grow as jobs get more complex, and Australia’s math skills decline <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/03/australian-students-maths-performance-falls-to-oecd-average-in-worst-result-since-2000">(Karp, 2019)</a> . By instantly generating quotes, QQC mitigates any risk of miscalculation, saving time and money for the business.Part of the time is spent in writing up quotes or creating quotes with computer software which then needs to be send by snail mail or email to the client requesting the quote. This application allows all the information gathered in the app to be collated into a quote document which can then be emailed to the client and saved to the app for the tradesman to refer to later. Our application will also have a handy laser tape measure that can be used to make measurements that can be automatically transferred to the current line item in the quote, so that the tradesman no longer needs to write down the measurements and manually enter them into the app, saving time and circumventing transcription errors.  
              <br>
                Having completed our viability research, we have decided that we will begin by creating a flow-chart to ensure that our application logic is sound, then create low-fidelity mock-ups so that we can test them with a small group of sympathetic tradesmen. This user testing will tell us if we need to make any alterations to our design plans and whether it will be well-received. Once we have incorporated their feedback, we will make up interactive wireframes so that we can test these on a larger scale. This will also show us where the links need to go to make sure that users can perform each task, save, or delete at each stage and that they can get back to the homepage at each stage. During this time, we will also ensure that we develop our safe storage practices for personal and business information that we will need to store. The final stage will be creating the application, testing it at each stage in the process to ensure that it is working to the standard that we have designed it to and preparing it for upload to the Apple Store and to the Google Store for sale and download.

            The goal is to develop a functional application, for both iOS, and Android. Upon completion, the application would run on mobile phones and tablets, in both landscape and portrait mode. It should be completely bug-free, run at 60 frames per second, and be presented with a clean, intuitive UI (User Interface). By developing the application in Unity, the app is easily built and deployed to all major mobile platforms. As this project entails many intricate elements, it will be necessary to maintain bite-sized goals, to make it achievable. When breaking down our project goals, the main consideration should always be ensuring that each goal is useful and achievable, with consideration to the primary elements of the application; content/features, frontend, and backend. All goals should be completed in the order listed below. This will ensure that any work which is foundational to the next step will be done first.

          According to the reviews, the other applications have not got some features that our application will have. Tradify is said not to have connections to suppliers for the tradies to get automatic prices for the items they want to quote on. It also does not have the ability to add photos to the job record or the quote which would be useful for sending progress reports to the clients. TradieCore is thought not to be fully coordinated with integration not available for some billing and accounting functions and technical support being slow to respond to queries. TradiezQuote has a reputation for easy-to-use business management tool. It does allow upload of photos and coordinates with accounting software but does not appear to have access to supplier databases or pricing structures.

          In today’s competitive market we were not expecting our app to be a first of its kind so we did a thorough research about all the applications available, and we established the following features which will make our app look different and eye catching.  
        </p>
        <h5>User Interface</h5>
        <p>
          We are intending to design a smart, uncluttered, and efficient interface for our users with larger 	buttons to guard against mis-clicks and clear text and icons for easy recognition so that there is no 	confusion finding the feature that is wanted.  
        </p>
        <h5>Laser Tape Measure</h5>
        <p>
          The laser tape measure will feed its results into the quotation software so that tradesmen can make measurements and not need to write down the measurements or transfer them manually into the quotation software. This is intended to remove a couple of steps from the process and guard against transcription errors which would affect the accuracy of the quotes.  
        </p>
        <h5>Customer Relation Management Functionality</h5>
        <p>
          Online Customer Service and Relational Management demonstrates the importance of our relationships with our customers. We have created an interface that will give our customers access to our service team whenever they need it. Note:  For the first iteration of the software, we have made available a quick link and third-party software so that our technical support team can problem-solve directly on the user’s device. The tech support interface has been postponed to a future iteration so that we can solve our development problems and ensure that when we present it to our customers it works in the way that we want it to and in the way that our clients expect it to.

          <br>
          The app itself provides a database of all previous quotes generated by the user. From this UI, the user can easily view a list of the quote history, complete with a basic summary of the job name, number of items on the quote, and the total quote price. This basic information about each quote helps the user easily find previous jobs, and quickly view the total quote value. This is useful for quickly finding and comparing previously entered quotes. The user may also wish to export a quote to a PDF, for seamless generation of customer quotes and receipts. This feature will likely be the primary source of monetisation within the app, as it is not required for the app to work but may be highly desirable for some businesses who wish to further streamline their workflow. From here the user may choose to view an existing quote by selecting the quote they want to view or generate a new quote by selecting the New Quote option – both routes will navigate the user to the Quote View window. In Quote View, the User Interface (UI) displays a list of job items, which each include an Item name, price per unit, and total price. At the top of the UI, the job/quote name is displayed, along with a Total quote value dollar figure which is updated every time any changes are made within the quote. For a new quote, these fields are filled with default values, and only one line item is added to the list. The default values act to give the user some pointers on where their desired job information should go (i.e. the default value for the overall job title would be “Job Title”). If the user has navigated here by selecting a previous quote, an appropriate number of line items are automatically added to the list, and all fields are populated as per the selected quote.
          <br><br>
          The key to this app’s power is the front-end component of this window. All line items are stored in a scrollable list, for easy viewing of limitless line items. Each line item has editable fields, and also includes arrows to the left and right of the quantity counter. This means that the user may simply press a button to add or subtract from the quantity of a line item, rather than having to select and edit the text inside the quantity field. The difference between a button interface and text input field seems trivial at first glance, but dramatically streamlines workflow, and is one of the key features of our app. Toward the bottom of this window will be options to delete the quote from the database, discard any changes, or save as a new quote. All of these features would be presented in a clean, easy-to-read format, with high contrast elements. This ensures maximum user accessibility and readability, making it and easy tool for anyone to use.
          <br>
        </p>
          <h6>An example case:</h6>
        <p>
          In a case where an electrician was required to generate a quote for installing lights and fans at a commercial premises, their quote may include quantities that run into the hundreds. Were that electrician to accidentally make an input error after counting hundreds of fans or lights, they would likely need to start all over again, potentially costing hours. This error may also easily go unnoticed, which could result in the final dollar figure of their quote being incorrect. This may cost the company money, or hurt their reputation and rapport with the customer. Aside from the factors of error elimination, this design also saves time whenever the quantity figure is added to or subtracted from, by providing a button-driven interface, rather than classic text input fields. Here at Quick Quotes Calculator, we have put this to the test by timing how long it takes us to enter text into an input field on a mobile device. By creating and timing events within a basic text input field with Unity, we found that it takes approximately 1.6 seconds to enter a single-character number into a text field. This is approximately 1.5 seconds longer than it takes to press a button. By this analysis, it is clear that our approach to numerical input has reduced this portion of the process by a factor of roughly 16 times.

        Customers are anticipated to be professionals who work in various aspects of the construction or building industries including builders and engineers. At this stage we are aiming for the construction and building industries and contractual arrangements with various suppliers will reflect this. However, if the application is successful in this field, we will expand our range of business partnerships to allow us to offer our application for the use of many more fields of business e.g., hospitality, gardening, cleaning services etc. These businesses all need to quote for their services, need to ensure that they have sufficient supplies to be able meet their clients demands and need to be able to provide an accurate quote of supplies and services.

    <p>
      Ultimately it is our intention to have a fully functional application that will provide a quick and easy calculator for creating quotes for construction projects.     
    </p>
    <p>
      The users must be able to enter and store their own companies’ information and logo, their customers information, and the details of each job, and keep the information fully protected as per the Australian Privacy Principles. (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, 2023). They will be able to enter each item of hardware and equipment, quantity, and cost from a variety of suppliers, see the ongoing total cost to the customer, and when the quote has been finalised, they should be able to add this information to a formal quotation document that can be sent via email to the customer in PDF format. This application will also facilitate the use of a laser measuring device of the user’s choice to be automatically activated in any field that requires measurement.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time we will create a database of resources for the use of our customers, however, in the interests of being able to provide a fully functional application in good time, we will enter into agreements with major resource providers such as Bunnings (Bunnings.com.au), Mitre 10 (https://www.mitre10.com.au), and local hardware suppliers to provide drop down lists of resources that can be selected in the application and automatic download of price per unit that will result in our application calculating total price per item.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first iteration of the functional application, we will limit the scope of the calculator to entering the users’ business details (for the invoices), the customer’s details, the materials and services that will be provided using materials lists provided by a number of suppliers and link these details to invoices that can be sent by email or to store the information for historical reference or for later editing. Our laser measure will automatically be made available for any item in the materials list that requires measurements. Several features are under consideration for later developments, however, for this first iteration, these are outside the scope. One of the features for later development will be online technical support, however, in the interests of being able to complete the project in good time, we will place a link in our application that will connect the phone to our technical support department and use a third-party application to allow the technical department to access the user’s mobile if necessary, e.g., Any Desk (AnyDesk, 2023).

        <h5>Goal 1: Outlining features and general layout </h5>
        <p>
          The first critical step is to outline exactly what features and windows/viewports the app should include. The aim of this goal is to plan an intuitive layout, which includes all relevant features, in a way that would make sense to the user. To achieve this, we will start by generating a list of primary features we want the app to have (i.e., view and edit quotes, store list of quotes, etc).         
        </p>
        <p>
           Next, we will map out a list of all windows the app will need. For example, a Main Menu, View Saved Quotes, and Quote view windows would be some of the windows this app would need to include. While a simple Word document (.docx) would be an acceptable format for this task, a simple graphical representation could also be provided. This will help the team to visualise how the app layout might look upon completion. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Once a full list of windows has been compiled, each window will be assigned a list of features it should contain. To decide which features to add to a window, we must consider the question; “What would I expect to see, and be able to do within this window, if I was the user?”. This would also include navigation items, which change the current window (i.e., View Saved Quotes window would have a feature which allows the user to select a previous quote, and open it in the View Saved Quotes window). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the list of all relevant features generated at the start of this task should be compared with the features included in our layout. It is likely that all expected features will already have been included through the designing of each window, so it is expected that very few, or no differences will be found between the list of included and expected features. If any expected features have not been included in our layout design, they should now be added to appropriate places within either an existing window, or a new window. If any new windows are created here, the same planning should be applied, to ensure they contain all necessary features.  
        </p>
        <h5>Goal 2: Designing the UI</h5>
        <p>
          Due to the planning done over the course of completing Goal 1, we expect to have a firm understanding of how many windows the app will include, as well as what features should be contained within each. The aim of this goal is to graphically plan how the UI will look within each window, with consideration to the features we decided upon previously. 
        </p>
        <p>
           This may be designed using Adobe XD, Unity, or a simple image processor, such as Photoshop or Gimp. Because the aim of this goal is purely to plan the UI design, choice of software and file format will be completely up to the discretion of the person undertaking this task. It may seem counter-productive to generate a non-interactive graphical version of our UI, however it may save us a large amount of time. Being easily able to quickly change, restyle, and add to graphical features is far more important here than generating any interactive functionality. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Upon completion of this task, the group should each review the graphical representation of our application, once again asking the question; “What would I expect to see, and be able to do within this window, if I was the user?”. If any group member finds missing, unnecessary, or out-of-place features, the design should be modified to include these changes. 
        </p>
        <h5>Goal 3: Developing an interactive UI </h5>
        <p>
          By this stage, we have a static (or highly limited) graphical representation of our UI. The aim of this goal is to develop a fully interactive UI in Unity. The UI will include input capabilities (i.e. touch inputs), scroll/interactive-viewing capabilities, buttons/OnClick() listeners, basic navigation, working input fields, etc. Each element of the design should be styled to match our design.  
        </p>
        <p> 
          The most effective way to achieve this goal will be to first design some UI object Prefabs, for any elements that appear multiple times throughout our design (i.e., confirmation window, scroll-view lists, etc.). This will massively increase the consistency and cleanliness of our design, cutting down hours spent re-designing elements, and fixing bugs. We will then develop each window, matching all visual constraints previously outlined in Goal 2. All features outlined in the design should be mimicked, and no new features should be added at this stage. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Upon completion of this goal, our UI will be fully interactive, and match our visual design. 
        </p>
        <h5>Goal 4: Testing the UI </h5>
        <p>
          Our UI appears functional, but may still contain some bugs, or require optimization. This goal will aim to find any bugs or performance issues regarding the UI, before continuing with any further integration of backend functionality. To achieve this, we will need to write a C# script, which writes message to the Unity editor console, whenever we interact with a UI element. These messages should be descriptive, and specify what action is being performed, and from where. For example, the Quote View window would have an input field, where the user may enter the name they wish to assign to the current quote. Our C# script should write a message to the console, saying something like: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              “Window: Quote View"
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              “Element: Quote name (input field)	Event: deselect"
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              “String parameter: ‘whatever was written in the field’”. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This message tells us that we are in the expected window, we have deselected the input field for Quote Name, and the text that we entered was ‘whatever was written in the field’. By repeating this process for every UI element, we can ensure full functionality of the application.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Because all UI functionality is driven by events, our script will need to locate each UI component. A method from our debugging class will be assigned to each of the listener in the project. This way, every individual component can be assigned unique parameters in Unity’s Inspector window. These parameters are now implicitly passed to our debugging method as parameters every time an event is called. As a result, we can easily pass these unique values to Debug.Log(), which writes them to our console. 
        </p>
        <h5>Goal 5: Developing the backend </h5>
        <p>
          Because this goal is independent to Goal 3 and Goal 4, it may be started at the same time as Goal 3. The backend functionality will not be integrated with frontend just yet. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          All backend development will be completed using C# and will focus one implementing classes which can deal with all data necessary for our app features to work as intended. The first stop of this process is designing our base data classes. Some of these would include: Quote(), LineIem(), FileManager(), etc. By designing these classes before developing further functionality, we massively improve the reusability of our code. To ensure all functionality requirements are met, we should answer the question; “Do my current classes cater for all data that is handled by each feature of Goal 2?”. If any features of the app appear to not have been catered for, consider where in the backend they belong. If they do not belong with any existing classes, we may write more, with consideration to cleanliness and reusability of code. 
        </p>
        <h5>Goal 6: Debug the backend </h5>
        <p>
          If the backend has been developed appropriately, this task should take very minimal effort. By using the debugging class we produced in Goal 4, we can call each backend method, and log the results, to indicate success or failure. A dummy set of data (i.e., 1000 randomly generated jobs) will be added to our database and used by the debugging script to automate some of our testing. Our debugging class will call various methods to instance, destroy, and mutate objects, using the backend methods. Expectant variable states are calculated by the debug class and compared to resultant states after each method call. This means that our debugger can point out differences between the expected and actual behaviour of our methods.  
          Our backend may still contain some bugs after this debugging process, which may become apparent when we combine our code with the UI. This will not be an issue, as we will be doing further debugging in Goal 8. 
        </p>
        <h5>Goal 7: Integrating backend and frontend </h5>
        <p>
          Now that our backend and fronted are complete, we can combine the two into a finished application. The aim of this goal is ensure all functionality is appropriately linked with the UI. To achieve this, we will create an object, with a C# script inheriting from Monobehaviour, attached as a component. This script will effectively control all functionality of the program. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The debugging script, which was written for Goal 5 contains paths to each UI component in the project, as well as a reference to our backend, which was added during Goal 6. We can copy these references to our new script, to ensure all of our UI components are accounted for and list their correct path. Because our event listeners will only have been assigned a debugging method at this stage, we will need to create a new method for receiving events. This method will contain all overloads (alternate constructors) needed to account for the different return types provided by different UI elements. This should account for situations where information such as index values of list items, or string content provided by the user need to be handled in different ways. Overloads alone may not be flexible enough to handle all potential UI events. If this is the case, we will need to provide multiple methods, to ensure all event-triggered functionality is accounted for. 
        </p>
        <p>
          By assigning frontend and/or backend methods to every event in the UI, we eliminate the need for an Update() method, which is a commonly used method in Unity, inheriting from Monobehaviour. The Update() method is used for checking all variables, and updating the renderer for each frame. By calling backend functions as they are needed, and updating the UI accordingly, there is no need to update anything with consideration to each frame. This approach will require us to take a lot of care when writing and assigning Event Listener methods, but will be far more performant, and much easier to debug. 
        </p>
        <P>
          This goal requires a deep understanding of both the frontend and backend, so should be undertaken by the frontend and backend developers in collaboration. By working together, the developers can share in-depth information about their design, and how they intended for it to be used. While the backend developer will likely lead the work done for this goal, the frontend developer will have greater insight into what the user wishes to see, and how they would like the interface to behave.  
        </P>  
        <h5>Goal 8: Test the application </h5>
        <p>
          The final product is complete, and should now be useable within the Unity editor, through the Game tab. We will be using the Unity editor’s Play Mode feature to run our project within the virtual environment of the Unity editor, prior to performing any kind of testing on mobile devices. To achieve this, the team members associated with Goals 1-3 will reference the expected functionality of each design element to the resultant functionality of the app within the Unity editor. Any issues regarding bugs, instabilities, or other issues of the app should be reported to, and addressed by, the backend developers. This way, the team members who best understand the UX approach of our app can provide constructive feedback to the team members who best understand how to fix the issue. This will help to ensure a smooth, and comprehensive optimisation process. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all functionality is debugged and optimized in the editor, we will test the app on some mobile devices. We will approach this by building our app for the mobile devices we have available and placing the app file into the local storage of the given device. This way, we will be viewing the app, exactly as it would look to a customer with the same device. Because the program is fundamentally bug-free at this stage, we will only be looking for mobile or device-specific issues. These may include things like file management not working correctly, scaling issues, touch inputs not working correctly, etc. The performance of the app should also be watched for any irregularities, that did not appear in the editor. Because mobile processors and operating systems are so different to PC/Mac, framerate drops, jittery animations, or other kinds of laggy behaviour may be observed. I f this is the case, we will use Unity Remote, and Unity’s Profile Analyzer to find what might be causing the lack in performance. Unity Remote allows the app to run on a USB-connected mobile device directly from the Unity editor. The Profile Analyzer then gives us feedback on the performance of our program, which we can use to optimize the application.

        Promotions would need to be aimed directly at workers in the industry and particularly at construction companies. We anticipate a general advertising campaign including radio, and professional publications, Facebook, etc.       
      </p>
      <p>
        According to a study by Edison Research, since the Covid pandemic radio listening in Australia has increased to almost 80% of the population across AM, FM, and DAB+ with radio being by far the most popular choice with the audio listeners spending over 13 hours per week listening time. Podcasts are also gaining in popularity, so it may be possible for a tradesman or information professional to create an industry podcast sponsored by our product to promote our product within the industry (Edison Research, 2022). 
      </p>
      <p>
        A more targeted campaign is anticipated for the larger organisations with a sliding scale of costs for the app to cater to the larger user groups that would be attracted by large companies subscribing to the app for their employees. These are thought to be personal visits to potential customer businesses or industry convention/exhibition presentations by our promotions team.

        Negotiate with hardware suppliers to gain access to their catalogue of tools and other products. It would be advantageous to have access to the catalogue of several suppliers to cater to the various accounts that construction professionals may have. We will need to contact the suppliers to see if they charge us for access to their catalogues or if they give them to us for free to promote their products and services and for the extra custom that they can expect by using the app.

      <h5>Unity</h5>
      <p>
        Unity (Unity, 2023) is a Game Engine, which runs on a virtual machine, and acts as a flexible way to develop 2D and 3D applications. It has streamlined capabilities, which easily build files for our target devices (iOS & Android) once the project is complete. Unity is also well-equipped with classes that help in building UI, such as interactive buttons (including event triggers), scrollable panels, re-scalable canvas, etc. On top of the frontend features, Unity provides simple ways to integrate the backend code with our frontend design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unity is free for any user who earns less than $100k per year, using their product. Were our revenue to exceed this figure, we would need to sign up for Unity Pro, at a cost of $40 per month. As this revenue threshold exceeds our scope for this project, we will not consider purchasing this subscription at this stage.
      </p>
      <h5>GitHub</h5>
      <p>
        GitHub (GitHub, 2023) will be a critical tool for managing version control, while working in a group. By tracking changes made by multiple users, GitHub gives us the power to review our progress, revert to earlier versions, and share changes between multiple users. This means that each member of the group can be actively working on a separate part of the project at the same time. 
      </p>
      <h5>Adobe XD</h5>
      <p>
        Adobe XD (Adobe, 2023) is an excellent tool for developing functional UI prototypes and designs. For the purpose of developing this project, Adobe XD will be highly useful when designing our UI. It allows us to quickly put together a design, which would take a lot longer in Unity. This will give us more time to play around with the design, and come up with a UI which is graphically appealing. This software will not be used for making the UI functional, as it will need to be recreated in Unity anyway. 
        Adobe XD is a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud bundle, which typically costs $54.99USD per month. As RMIT students, we have free access to this software, so do not have to pay the subscription fee.

They have an established database of products that they have collected over a period of 4-5 years. This would negate the need for contracts with individual suppliers, however contracts with suppliers would mean that any errors in quotes may be mitigated under the terms of any contract with them e.g. They would need to ensure that their information is correct or honour the error.

        Perhaps in a later iteration we could offer the app for iPad or Android tablet since many engineers and specialised quoters use these devices.

        In Phase 4 we can expand our user base with extra features and more devices.

        The app will allow businesses to enter their logo and business name, address, contact details, the name of the person making the quote as well as terms and conditions.

      </p>
      <p>
        The information about the business making the quotation and the customer will be stored in a secure database and every care will be taken to ensure that any personal information will be protected in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, 2023).

            <br>
            For the development of this project, we will be using the Unity game engine. This platform is highly versatile and can directly build applications for “+25 leading platforms” <a href="https://unity.com/">(Unity, 2023)</a>, including target platforms (IOS and Android), with minimal variation in the build process. This is method is far superior to using platforms such as Android Studio and XCode, because it means that we only have to create the application once. Once the app is developed, it can be deployed to both platforms by simply changing the Build settings. This is particularly important when working on a team with varying skillsets, because the learning curve for each person to adopt two new platforms is too great for this task. Although engines such as Unreal and Godot have similar perks, Unity has been selected for its’ “low entry threshold” <a href="https://unity.com/">(Unity, 2023)</a>, and its $0 price tag. Unity also has a feature called ‘PlayerPrefs’, which allows data to easily be stored. This eliminates any variations in file management between IOS and android, as well as PC which will be used regularly for testing development versions of this app. Any data stored in PlayerPrefs is also persistent across updates, meaning the user can confidently update their app without fear of losing records. All these features are facilitated using .NET infrastructure (C#), which is regularly updated and documented by Microsoft, making it reliable and easy to learn. As C# is a low-level language with very flexible, simple abstraction, it is perfect for effectively handling complex data classes, which is key to smooth, correct, and expandable functionality of this app. While Unity is packed with many great beginner-friendly features, “You won’t find any structured UI in this engine like in others” <a href="https://neurosys.com/blog/why-people-say-unity-engine-is-bad#:~:text=Unity%20is%20a%20multi%2Dplatform,without%20extensive%20programming%20knowledge%20needed">(Neurosys, n.d.)</a>. This means that a large portion of development will go toward developing and refining quality UI features, using the limited UI Toolkit that Unity provides. As outlined in <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UI-system-compare.html">Unity’s platform documentation</a>, “in the current release, UI Toolkit does not have some features” which were included in superseded Toolkits. From our experience here at DualCab, the Unity UI building features are not only lacking in some ways but are far inferior to toolkits provided in platforms such as Xcode. This will be the greatest challenge in using the Unity platform. The only part of this project that will not be completed in Unity will be the graphics, as it has no image or vector manipulation features. All image processing will be handled using Gimp or Photoshop (for bitmap), and Inkscape or Illustrator (for vector). While Gimp and Inkscape are great free open-source options, some team members may choose to use Photoshop or Illustrator. This choice come down to nothing more than the personal preference of each team member, as both alternatives have equivalent functionality. Finally, a GitHub repository will be used to contribute and track project changes amongst all members of the group. This repository should be set to private, as only the source files will be available here, and we do not wish for anyone else to be able to access these.          <br>

          </p>
          <h3>Week 2</h3>
          <p>
            Begin writing content for assignments and exploring how our app should work. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 3</h3>
          <p>
            Continue writing content for assignments. Begin wireframe of UI and research tools required for development and implementation of our app. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 4</h3>
          <p>
            Develop other artefacts such as sample screenshots of UI; thoroughly develop the content behind what is required to develop our app and how to implement it. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 5</h3>
          <p>
            Ramp up completing content for assignments. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 6</h3>
          <p>
            Complete submission of A3 and A5. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 7</h3>
          <p>
            Continue developing wireframe and the design of UI. Research similar apps and similar implementations of features, along with design concepts. Some team members also need to focus on completing online learning modules in using Unity (frontend), and others to focus on completing online learning modules in C# language (backend). 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 8</h3>
          <p>
            Complete design of UI. The team will essentially split into two groups after completing the design phase – one team of 3 to develop the frontend, and one team of 3 to develop the backend, with open communication between groups throughout / regular meetings to coordinate effectively commence creating frontend in Unity, and coding the backend in C#. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 9</h3>
          <p>
            Continue developing frontend and backend whilst communicating and making any necessary amendments to both. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 10</h3>
          <p>
            Continue developing frontend and backend whilst communicating and making any necessary amendments to both. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 11</h3>
          <p>
            Continue developing frontend and backend whilst communicating and making any necessary amendments to both. Begin testing and debugging whilst refining to work towards completion of both frontend and backend. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 12</h3>
          <p>
            Aim for completion of frontend and backend development. Further testing and debugging – thorough and well-documented to capture every conceivable scenario. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 13</h3>
          <p>
            Commence integration of backend and frontend – whole team back together to work on this. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 14</h3>
          <p>
            Complete integration of backend and frontend. Being testing whole application – again thoroughly documenting every conceivable scenario. 
          </p>
          <h3>Week 15</h3>
          <p>
            Testing and debugging to continue – anticipate this will take some weeks longer. Will need to thoroughly cover all security aspects without rushing to completion of app. Aim for app launch around Week 26 to allow enough time for legal, security, financial, stakeholder concerns to be managed thoroughly.

        Throughout the development process of this app, many skills will be required, including frontend development, generation and manipulation of 2D graphics, as well as backend programming. The front-end portion of this task will require the team to create a neat, smoothly functional, easy to read interface. Due to Unity’s limited UI toolkit, great care will need to be taken to ensure the interface functions, looks, and scales exactly as intended. This will involve researching how other mobile apps are laid out, and emulating some of those design constraints. All graphics generated will need to be fit for purpose, meaning image manipulation skills will be critical to ensuring the UI looks perfect. All logos, background panels, button icons etc. will need to be designed with performance, scalability, image quality and compatibility in mind. To achieve this, a wide array of digital image manipulation skills is required. In contrast to the frontend development, the backend will require a strong knowledge of the OOP paradigm, and some understanding of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">.NET/C#</a>. These skills would be greatly complimented by an aptitude for logic and math, for cleanly, accurately, and efficiently handling complex data. These backend skills will also determine how fast or slow the final product will be, as poor programming practices are particularly harmful to the performance of mobile devices.
