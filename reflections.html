          <p class="float-right center">In Assignment 2 most of our communication was via Microsoft Teams, with asynchronous communication between each other as we progressed with tasks, as well as twice-weekly MS Teams meetings where we would discuss the team’s progress and any issues. Our team worked well over MS Teams, though one of our team members suddenly became unresponsive, and we weren’t sure at the time how long to allow them to reply before raising it with our course facilitators. This became a good learning experience for our team, and the remaining team handled it very well. Though it did cause troubles with our planned task allocation, and we had to change our IT project late on. From this experience we have grown to have expectations of meeting attendance and activity on MS Teams, as well as improving our task allocation and tracking of outstanding tasks. 
          </p>
          <p class="float-right center">Our team also used a Trello board to allocate some tasks, but we all experienced some technician problems accessing the Trello board at times, so we have decreased our expectations of using Trello to map everything out. Our team leader, Lachie, instead created an MS Excel spreadsheet to track tasks through to completion, paired with a more granular view of the tasks in a text file. 
          </p>
          <p class="float-right center">Another process we have refined since Assignment 2 is to ensure all team members use in-line citations and a reference list when contributing written sections to the submission document. This should decrease the amount of work required to create a reference section at time of finalising the submission document. 
          </p>
          <p class="float-right center">Overall, we our group processes in Assignment 2 worked quite well, but with experience we refined how our team communicated, collaborated, allocated and tracked tasks. Our use of tools changed to suit our team better. 
          </p>
          <p class="float-right center">Our reliance on GitHub dramatically reduced for Assignment 3. In Assignment 2 we all learned to use GitHub and used it to store all our working documents in the team’s repository. This worked well, but when it became time to compile all this information into the submission PDF it became clear that it might be easier to input the information directly into the submission document throughout the course of the assignment. We are not using GitHub to store parts of the submission and are instead using a shared Word Document in MS Teams. We all update this draft submission document as we progress through our own tasks. GitHub was still a necessary, and useful, tool for our team during the build of our website for Assignment 3.

          <p class="float-right center">We have evidence of our group communication over MS Teams and Trello, where we have consistently kept in touch while working on tasks. The Tools section of this document contains an invite link to our MS Teams Team, as well as our MS Teams meeting evidence. Further information can be found in the MS Teams Info PDF “Group2-MS.PDF” submitted along with this document.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">We also used Trello to break down the assignment into more manageable “cards”, which were then assigned to team members, where we could then provide updates on our progress, and move them to another “stack” once completed.
          To view all our Trello data please join our Trello Board at <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/63b0a29a7d31fd04d45b041d/ATTI4b36907d71e02e8ed9b4d09d82719fa1CC0E3036/Intro%20to%20IT%20" target="_blank">https://trello.com/invite/b/63b0a29a7d31fd04d45b041d/<br>ATTI4b36907d71e02e8ed9b4d09d82719fa1CC0E3036/Intro%20to%20IT%20</a></p>
          <p class="float-right center">We have also used our Student Email (Outlook) and Collaborate Ultra (on Canvas) when corresponding with facilitators. The emails were relating to resolving an issue with an unresponsive team member, and the Collaborate Ultra sessions were in our weekly tutorial sessions where we discussed our progress and issues with Umera each week. All course facilitators were included on the emails, and the Collaborate Ultra sessions can be viewed via Canvas as evidence.</p>

          <p class="float-right center">Our team learnt a lot from working together for A2. We approached A3 and A5 in a different way, to avoid foreseeable issues. For example, the allocation of tasks was much more specific, with approximate time required for each task to be completed, which allowed us to try to spread the workload in an equal manner. </p>
          <p class="float-right center">We also learned that using a shared live document on Teams suited us better than contributing separate files in GitHub, especially after our GitHub had major technical issues just before submission of A2. Using this shared live document also increased visibility of what has been done, and what is remaining (as did the tracking spreadsheet we used for task allocation). </p>

          <p class="float-right center">Despite most members being introverted, the team still operated effectively. We learned technical skills from other group members (e.g., GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and how to implement a team project in an IT environment. We learned how to work as a global team, communicating asynchronously and in regular meetings to keep on track. We’ve also learned how to make meaningful and frequent Git Commits to reflect what we’ve done in a more visible and trackable manner.</p>

          <p>I have found this time around better in ways and challenging in others. This time around we were more proactive in addressing Tech issues due to experiencing them last time, implementing such control measures such as ensuring we our work is saved locally, GitHub is closely monitored, and major edits need to be ticked off by other members. Now we are aware of each other's strengths and weaknesses because of the previous assignment, we allocated tasks that matched our skillset, and this aid the progress of the assignment. Personally, my dialogue increased majorly with the team due to rapport and having primary knowledge of them personally, this has increased team morale from my point of view. We did face some challenges though, like all teams. Team members personal lives impacted the dialogue and unfortunately temporality halted progress of the assignment, but with mediation we were able to resolve the issue and continue to work towards a common goal and that was ensure the continuality and completion of the assignment. Nevertheless, we have created a bond that will continue after this study period and will have support from each other in our future academic endeavours. </p>
          <h5>What I found suprising</h5>
          <p>Conflict between team members was unexpected – thought process behind a simple application – a lot of planning and development which may take years. </p>

          <p>This course has been a learning experience, and I have pushed each member of the group to learn about themselves and each other. It has required us to do a diverse range of work and challenges, requiring many skills. I learned how to work more effectively in a group, and how beneficial a versatile skillset of many group members can be. The greatest key to our success throughout this project has been effectively identifying strengths and weaknesses of each group member and assign tasks which are suitable for each group member. This helped in gaining maximum efficiency from each of us. </p>
          <p> The greatest challenge we faced was the negative impact our motivation faced among the group, when we were notified that the Bachelor in IT was being discontinued. We have worked hard to overcome this issue and have done well to get together a submission despite the challenge. </p>
          <h5>What I found suprising</h5>
          <p>I found it unexpected that some group members fought against the organisational tactics being used by most of the group. It has been a challenging project, but I have also been surprised by how well the group members who are left have worked over the past weeks. </p>

          <p>This is our second assignment we are doing together and looking forward to third as a team. I think I have worked enough with them as team and by now I can safely say we are a great team and I feel myself lucky to be part of it. When we started, we were not knowing each other except that we are in the same university doing same degree and same subject but when we started working together, we came to know each other very well. We know how resolve issues arising from team working style without hurting anyone’s feelings. Everything we do we keep each other informed and updated. We help each other to achieve our goal. We care for each other not only professional but personally too.  </p>
          <p>I learned a lot while working as a part of this team as I was very new to this sector not knowing much about tools used in this sector, but my team was very patient with me helped in every way they could and now I know these tools. Modern technologies and tools which I have learned being part this team can be used by me in my professional life in IT sector. </p>
          <p>The learning experience from this for me is that sometimes all the planning in the world cannot stop unforeseeable serious issues in a group environment, especially when the issue makes the team members unsure whether there is much reason for the group existing anymore. It has been disappointing and demoralising, though I have found some support and guidance from group members throughout. </p>
          <h5>What I found suprising</h5>
          <p>Myers-Briggs seemed pretty accurate with my traits that have come out in force with this assignment with conflict resolution etc. Also, the amount of work involved for the assignment was suprising. </p>

          <p>The group started off extraordinarily strong for A3/A5, after learning from how we could improve from reflecting on how we worked together on A2. Lachie remained team leader and invested a lot of extra time and effort organising – going through the assignment specifications and rubric and breaking it all down to a list of tasks, which also had approximate hours for completion all on a tracking spreadsheet to ensure we didn’t miss anything and could easily see how we are tracking to completion. </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, our group dynamic suffered a bit of a blow – likely to do with RMIT ceasing our degree and leaving us in limbo finishing subjects that no longer exist. We have really struggled to keep motivated as a team because of this, which was probably not avoidable given the circumstances. </p>
